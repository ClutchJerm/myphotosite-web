# MyPhotosite.me

Originally built in 2012 as a personal photography website with extensive photo organizing and customization capabilities, it's now being rewritten in React, with the backend functionality moved to a Ruby/Sinatra API.

During the rewrite, multitenancy will be added, providing a free, uniquely customizable photo showcase to anyone and everyone.
