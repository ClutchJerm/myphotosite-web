# MyPhotosite.me

Originally built in 2012 as a personal photography website with extensive photo organizing and customization capabilities, it's now being rewritten in React, with the backend functionality moved to a Ruby/Sinatra API.

During the rewrite I plan to add:
- Multitenancy, providing a free, uniquely customizable photo showcase to anyone and everyone.
- Dropbox support to allow near instant importing off existing content
- Better mobile UX to gather the shares and likes on social media

Here's what we're talking about! (please excuse LICECap's downgrading/clipping)
